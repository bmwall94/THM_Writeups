Room description: 
Learn about, then enumerate and exploit a variety of network services and misconfigurations.


**Author's notes:**
At the time of this writeup, I was still a beginner. It was my first time using SMB, telnet, FTP connections, as well as netcat, reverse-shells, and hydra.
I personally felt this was a gross scope for a beginner and it took me way longer than 60 minutes for me to complete it. That being said, it is fun, interesting
and easy (once you understand everything). This room was completed on Jun 22, 2024 using a virtual machine running Kali Linux through 


Task 1 - Get Connected
  Question 1: Ready? Let's get going!
  Answer: No answer needed.

Task 2 - Understanding SMB

  All of the questions for Task 2 can be answered by reading the material in this section.
  
  Question 1: What does SMB stand for?
  Answer: Server Message Block
  Question 2: What type of protocol is SMB?
  Answer: response-request
  Question 3: What do clients connect to servers using?
  Answer: TCP/IP
  Question 4: What systems does Samba run on?
  Answer: Unix

Task 3 - Enumerating SMB

  Question 1: Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing. How many ports are open?

  

  Answer: 3

  Question 2: What ports is SMB running on?

  

  Answer: 139/445

  Question 3: Let's get startus with Enum4Linux. Conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the workgroup name?

  

  Answer: WORKGROUP

  Question 4: What comes up as the name of the machine?



  Answer: POLOSMB

  Question 5: What operating system version is running?



  Answer: 6.1

  Question 6: What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?

  

  Answer: profiles

Task 4 - Exploiting SMB
  Question 1: What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as a user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?

  Answer: smbclient//10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445

  Question 2: reat! Now you've got a hang of the syntax, let's have a go at trying to exploit this vulnerability. You have a list of users, the 
  name of the share (smb) and a suspected vulnerability.

  Answer: No answer needed.

  Question 3: Lets see if our interesting share has been configured to allow anonymous access, I.E it doesn't require authentication to view the files. 
  We can do this easily by:

- using the username "Anonymous"

- connecting to the share we found during the enumeration stage

- and not supplying a password.

Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?

  Question 4: Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?

  Question 5: What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?

  Question 6: Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?

  Question 7: This directory contains authentication keys that allow a user to authenticate themselves on, and then access, a server. 
  Which of these keys is most useful to us?

  Answer:

  Download this file to your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".

  Now, use the information you have already gathered to work out the username of the account. Then, use the service and key to log-in to the server.

  What is the smb.txt flag?
